# === Textures ===
# Ignore specific image file types within the textures directory.
# This keeps the 'textures/' directory itself potentially trackable (if it's empty
# or contains other files like a README), but ignores the large image assets.
textures/*.jpg
textures/*.jpeg
textures/*.png
textures/*.gif
textures/*.bmp
textures/*.tif
textures/*.tiff
textures/*.webp
# Add any other image formats you might use here

# Optional: If you are absolutely sure you NEVER want to track anything
# inside the textures folder (including potential subfolders or other file types),
# you could use this simpler rule instead of listing extensions:
# textures/
